# CS181_FinalProject
This is the repository for our Harvey Mudd CS 181 course's final project. Our project intends to create an algorithm that can perform various functions within the game of CodeNames®. We use Google's word2vec model to help determine similarities between given words. This project aims to test the limits of word2vec and compare it to how well humans perform in CodeNames®.
