    "There is a board generated with 25 words. Each word falls into a category: red, blue, neutral, assassin. \n",
    "Most people cannot see the classifications of the words, just the words themselves.\n",
    "There are two teams with multiple people on each team. Each team chooses a spymaster who is able to see the classification\n",
    "of the words. Based on the board, they have to give one word clues to their team so the team is able to guess their words\n",
    "Along with the one word clue, the spymaster has to give a number to signify how many words on the board are associated with the clue. The team guesses the words one by one and they may use up the entire number given along with one other guess. They are also able to give infinite clues. This is typically done at the end when the team should not have a limit on how many words they can guess. The team that starts has 9 words on the board because they have the advantage of going first and the second team has 8 words to guess. If they guess a word that is not their color, the team's turn ends automatically. If the team chooses the assassin, they automatically lose. "

    "Our proposal:\n",
    "For now we are working on three projects: \n",
    "(1) a program where we input a board and a clue and the program tells us how good of a clue it is. \n",
    "(2) Then we have a second program where given a clue, the program tells us what word(s) on the board most closely matches with the clue given. Essentially be the player/guesser to the spymasters. \n",
    "(3) Make a website with a flask that is able to run the first two functions. If we have time, we make the website with better functionality.\n",
    "(4) Figure out if there is a better algorithm or way to get the program to give us a decent clue based on the board. Our initial exploration failed here, but we can look into new ways of doing this. "

    "\n",
    "-At first we thought we could  ask the program to give us a clue based on the team’s words but we found out that eventually it was not possible because our model did not have the parameters or the capacity to make all the connections between the words. Given 4 words it was spitting out weird clues like \"purple SUV van\" or \"scraggly purse snatcher\". Even with obvious connections, it was struggling a lot. We tested using the GoogleAPI since the word2vec definitely did not have enough words to make an educated guess. We then found out that the GoogleAPI was not good either because there is a lot of connections to be made to a word that a program just can't store by itself. We then modified our proposal and started working on small projects as well. \n",
    "-We imported a list of all possible words (as a csv file) in codenames so we can process these words easily.\n",
    "-We created GitHub repository where we have several files. One file is a jupyter notebook and for testing individual functions. Then we have a python program where we intend to run the entire program. Then we have this proposal in there.  \n",
    "-We created outlines for two functions which are the first two subprojects mentioned in our proposal.\n",
    "-We created functions that make two random boards. One is a player board and one is spymaster board. The player board can only see words on the board and the spymaster board where we see the classifications of the words. So a spymaster can see if a word is theirs, their opponent’s, a neutral word, or the assassin word. We eliminated the colors for some of the functions because it would be easier to do input if it weren’t based on a team. We are wokring on a Game or Board class that will incorporate color as a member variable there. \n",
    "-We also created three functions fully. \n",
    "    def make_codenames_guess( clue, LoW, m ) (with significant help from Prof Dodds), which defines m to be word-vector model from somewhere, LoW == any list of words (strings), clue == a single word (string). This ends up returning an array of tuples of the score and the word itself. This is a starting point for making a guess given a clue and a board of letters. We will have to figure out a scoring system to determine which are the best words to use and what the cut off should be for that.\n",
    "    def generate_board(model), which generates a board made of words at random so we don’t have to input words all the time. This is a function to help us train the program to determine words and to test it without actually having to generate a board on our own. We are returning a spymaster board, a regular player board, and who goes first in this case. \n",
